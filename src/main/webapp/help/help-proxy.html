	The proxy settings to pass to the Kiuwan Local Analyzer process when analyzing.
	<p>Note that this proxy can be different than the configured 
	<a href="pluginManager/advanced" target="_blank">Jenkins proxy settings</a>,
	so you can use different settings when executing Kiuwan analyses (that may run on remote nodes 
	with different access needs).</p>
